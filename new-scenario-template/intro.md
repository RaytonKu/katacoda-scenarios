# Restaurant booking service: Eat Everywhere

We are going to do a restaurant booking service. People get the restaurant information through our platforms like phone numbers, opening hours, and menu and make bookings based on their thoughts. They can simply leave their first name and phone number for the reservation. They can make the reservation any time and anywhere.

## Microservices

The Establishment & Menu API allows you to manage menu items as well as information about the restaurant. Create and update menus, modify dishes, and configure restaurant API endpoints for online and offline use.

The Booking API allows the restaurant to receive and manage incoming orders. Eat Everywhere's inbound booking alerts, and cancellations are included in the API. The Order API will enable the restaurant to retrieve, accept, deny, and cancel bookings.
